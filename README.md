# Livesplit-AutoTimers-Steam

# SETUP:
Open LiveSplit > Right Click > Edit Layout > + > Control > Scriptable Auto Splitter

# Recommendations for AutoSplitter:
-Make sure your LiveSplit is comparing against Game Time and for SubSplits, Splits, Timer, Detailed Timer, Etc... in "Timing Method" I recommend using "Current Timing Method"

-Use SubSplits

-Use Detailed Timer
